# WhatsNear-Backend

This Project Serves as the Backend for [WhatsNear](https://github.com/RyanWangGit/WhatsNear).

The WhastNear project uses Github Pages to present itself to the public, thus theorectically there **should not** be a backend for that project. 

This very project is of course not the so-called `backend` for `WhatsNear`, it is a project that implements multiple different algorithms to dig / mine the associations between `POIs`(Point of Interests) from a library of pure `POIs`, the mined results are thus assembled and sent to [WhatsNear](https://github.com/RyanWangGit/WhatsNear) for visualization purposes.
